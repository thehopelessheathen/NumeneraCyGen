E;Sends a creature or object weighing ^ or less hurtling away from the user up to a Short distance. If the target impacts something of sufficient mass to stop it (a wall, an equally-sized creature), the target stops moving and both it and the thing that stopped it take $ points of damage. If the target doesn't impact anything, it still takes 2 points of damage from skidding along the ground. A creature can avoid moving more than an Immediate distance with a difficulty $ Might defense roll, though it still takes 2 points of damage. Likewise, a creature or object too big to be moved still takes 2 points of damage.
