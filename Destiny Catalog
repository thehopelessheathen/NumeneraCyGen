F;Bulky handheld device, Bulky device worn on back
V;
T;
E;When activated, any exposed metallic weapons within short range crackle with electricity for about an hour, granting affected weapons 1 additional point of damage when used in combat. Weapons that enter the area after the initial activation do not receive this bonus.

{Hitch-Recaller
D;6
B;2
F;Handheld device
V;
T;
E;When activated, the cypher splits into two pieces. One piece is affixed to a numenera structure of level 5 or above, and the other is kept by a character. The character can then use the connection between the two pieces to trigger a spatial warp any time within the next 28 hours. The spatial warp returns the user and all targets within immediate range to a location next to the numenera structure, no matter how far apart the character and the structure were. Creating the spacial warp requires power drawn from the numenera device, forcing a depletion roll (or destroying it if it is a cypher). If the device is depleted before the spacial warp, the cypher becomes useless, and the other piece notifies the user.

{Emotion Smoother
D;6
B;0
F;Pill, Ingestible fluid, Injector, Adhesive patch
V;
T;
E;For the next hour, the character loses access to the part of their mind that registers and produces emotion.

V;
T;
E;For the next ten minutes, the user can be heard at any distant location that they can see, as long as nothing physically blocks the intervening space. They can also hear sounds made in return. The area in which the user can speak and hear is up to a short distance across in the target location.

V;
T;
E;Once placed, the plates change the direction of gravity within an area up to a short distance in diameter.

F;Dart-sized device with drill head, Sphere with screw protrusion
V;
T;
E;The user attaches this cypher to a wall or other structure of level $ or lower. On the following round, it drills into the object and keeps going beneath the surface for the next hour, creating a series of tunnels that weaken the integrity of the structure and reduce its level by 3. If a structure's level is reduced to 0 or lower, it is instead destroyed.
}

{Mass Mover
D;6
B;3
F;Bulky device worn on back and several metal plates attached to object
V;
T;
E;When securely attached to an unanchored object that weighs less than $0 tons, it allows the object to be moved to another location within Very Long range. Doing so requires that the user be able to push or pull the object to the new location, but for about an hour, the object seems almost weightless.
}

{Instant Item
D;6
B;0
F;Amulet, Bracelet, Ring, Small crystal, Handheld device
V;
T;
E;This cypher has a two-stage activation. The first stage occurs when the wearer keys an object that they can hold in one hand to the cypher. The object falls into a subspace pocket and remains indefinitely or until a user activates the cypher a second (and final) time, immediately retrieving the stored item.
}

{Instant Wall

F;Pill-shaped device, Beam-emitting device
V;
T;
E;With the addition of water and air, the small device produces an immobile plane up to 10 feet (3 m) tall, 30 feet (9 m) long, and 2 feet (60 cm) thick. It is made from a form of shapestone and is permanent and immobile once created.
}

{Instant Workshop

F;Cube-shaped device, Beam-emitting device
V;
T;
E;This small device produces a workbench that fixes itself in place. The workbench provides an adjustable-height work surface with light and a variety of attached tools suitable for working with commonplace objects, numenera objects, and structural components. The workshop enables crafting tasks by providing the appropriate tools and workspace, though it does not provide shelter from the elements. The workbench and all its components are made from a form of shapemetal, and the workbench is permanent and immobile once created.

}

{Organ Factory
D;6
B;0
F;Pill, Injector, Ingestible fluid
V;
T;
E;Over the course of 28 hours, the user grows an external, fully viable living organ or limb chosen by the user at the time of activation. This is a somewhat painful process that dazes the user for the last half of the process. The completely grown organ or limb can be transferred to another creature simply by placing it on their body and waiting a few rounds. If the recipient creature has sustained damage to the same kind of organ or limb, the newly grown one replaces it over the course of about a minute (during which time the recipient creature is stunned). Otherwise, the duplicate organ or limb withers and dies. Duplicate organs must be used within one week. All force-grown organs and limbs are sealed within a partially living, protective, translucent caul.

While in stasis, they also lose their next turn. Attacks against a wearer in stasis are made as if the wearer were protected by an impenetrable force field of level $.
}

T;28 hours:0, 2 days:2, 3 days:3, 4 days:4, 5 days:5, 6 days:6
E;The user and any additional targets that can fit into a space an immediate distance in diameter are encapsulated in a spherical force field for up to ten hours or until the user collapses it. The sphere hovers at all times and moves as the user wishes vertically or horizontally up to a short distance each round. If the sphere is destroyed or collapsed, whatever it contains falls to the ground.
