V;
T;1:0, 2:3, 3:5, 4:7
DT;0
DD;6
E;When placed on the wearer's flesh, the armor grafts on permanently. It provides +^ Armor but does not hinder movement or tire the wearer in any way (no Speed cost increase for applying Effort). On the contrary, the wearer's maximum Might Pool is permanently increased by 2. However, the benefits come at a cost. Fibrous tendrils extend into the wearer's flesh and eventually reach the spine and brain, inflicting damage in the form of 2 points of permanent maximum Intellect Pool reduction. This process takes one week, after which the wearer can feel through the armor as if it were their own skin. The lost points cannot be regained.

T;10 minutes:0, 1 hour:9
DT;1
DD;10
E;This armor is far hardier yet somewhat lighter than Ninth World smithing techniques could ever manage with steel. It is heavy armor but grants an additional +1 Armor in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor usually provides. Further, when activated, it shifts the wearer's phase randomly for ^, hindering attacks on the wearer by two steps. This will not cause the character to phase through the ground, and it generally won't affect their ability to carry or interact with objects. If depleted, the dimensional phasing no longer functions, but the suit still functions as armor.
}

{Disrupting Blade
